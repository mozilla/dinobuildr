# wallpaper in macOS Mojave, or uses the old tried and true Applescript method
# of setting the wallpaper, depending on the OS version this script is being run
# on.

# You can see Steve's script the follow github repo: https://github.com/tech-otaku/macos-desktop

# We fork the repo so that we can ensure that we have access to a version of
# this project.
